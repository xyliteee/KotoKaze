Kotokaze, a graduation project by an undergraduate student, is a software that integrates a bunch of miscellaneous functions. 
It uses the OpenHardwareMonitor project: https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor

The features it includes are as follows:

1.Display of basic information and recording device data for analysis (somewhat fun)

2.Clearing some junk (somewhat fun), conveniently deleting programs (somewhat fun), defining cleaning rules to customize file deletion (somewhat useful)

3.Benchmark testing (GPU not available, overall somewhat fun)

4.Some other features (presumably somewhat useful)
